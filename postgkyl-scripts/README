Gkeyll postprocessing scripts
=============================

This folder keeps postprocessing scripts that people develop for their own work, which may be useful to others and which has not yet made it into `postgkyl <https://github.com/ammarhakim/postgkyl>`_.

Some suggestions:
1. Create a folder with your first name initial and last name, and place/develop your scripts within it.
2. You are free to use scripts from others. You are also free to contribute to them, but in that case do so in a branch and have the owner of that folder review your PR.
3. Please follow good coding/version control practices.

Alternative method: git submodule
1. Stay in the gkylzero-apps folder to execute these commands
2. git submodule add https://github.com/user/mypersonnalrepo.git postgkyl-scripts/mydirectoryname
3. git submodule update --init --recursive
4. git commit -m "Add my repository as a submodule"
5. (Optional) git push
