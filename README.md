About
-----

This repo contains stand-alone "apps" that are used for solving
specific problems using the GkeylZero library. GkeyllZero itself
provides three major Apps: the suite of Vlasov-Maxwell equations,
gyrokinetics and multi-moment multifluid apps. The apps in this repo
are usually for simple equation systems, or for problems that have a
struture simpler than the GkeyllZero native apps themselves.
